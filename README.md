# Fuzzy-neural-networks

Fuzzy System : It has all the source code for Implementing basic Fuzzy Inference from scratch. (Credits: 2020 Raul Navarro-Almanza, Universidad Aut√≥noma de Baja California)
( The code in this folder is not written by me, but I understood the whole scource code in order to optimize the generation of Membership function parameters using Genetic Algorithm)
Datasets :
1. Iris Dataset: iris-attr.txt, iris-train.txt
2. Wine Quality Dataset: wine-attr.txt, winequality.csv 
Scripts:
Iris-main.py - (Used Genetic algorithm to generate membership function parameters and uses FIS to evaluate and train the data)
Iris-NN.py - Training the data using Neural network
wine-main.py - (Used Genetic algorithm to generate membership function parameters and uses FIS to evaluate and train the data)
Wine-NN.py - Training the data using Neural network

ML_report.pdf - paper 


PS: All the code in the script files is written by me (Each script has its implementation of Genetic Algorithm and Neural network, without using any libraries, written by me)

But the code in Fuzzy System folder uses (Numpy and Matplotlib as external libraries for visualization of the Membership functions)
